Predictive Modeling & Intelligent Customer Spending Analysis for Focused Financial Insights

Overview:-This project focuses on understanding and predicting customer spending behavior using Indian personal finance data. By leveraging machine learning, feature engineering, and statistical analysis, it classifies customers as high spenders or low spenders. The insights derived enable financial institutions and businesses to deliver targeted offers, personalized credit plans, and optimized saving strategies.
The project aims to combine predictive modeling with business intelligence to enhance decision-making and improve customer engagement.

Objectives:-The main objective of this project is to classify customers into high and low spenders using supervised machine learning models, enabling businesses to better understand and target their customer base. The project involves analyzing financial behavior through feature importance and correlation analysis to identify the key factors that influence spending patterns. To ensure fair and unbiased model predictions, class imbalance will be addressed using techniques such as SMOTE. Multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression implemented with TensorFlow and PyTorch, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, will be compared to determine the most effective approach. The results will be visualized using ROC curves, confusion matrices, and radar charts, providing clear and interpretable insights. Ultimately, the project aims to offer actionable business recommendations by linking spending patterns to demographic features, helping organizations optimize marketing strategies, customer engagement, and resource allocation.

Dataset:-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shriyashjagtap/indian-personal-finance-and-spending-habits

1. Data Collection and Importing Libraries:-The first step involves gathering customer data, which may include demographic details (age, gender, location), financial transactions, and spending history. Once the data is collected, essential Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch for machine learning will be imported to facilitate data analysis and model building.
2. Data Exploration and Understanding:- After importing the dataset, initial exploration is performed to understand its structure. This includes viewing the first few rows of data using .head(), checking data types with .dtypes, summarizing statistics using .describe(), and identifying missing values with .isnull().sum(). Columns are examined to understand which features are numerical, categorical, or target variables. This step lays the groundwork for feature engineering and visualization.
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:- Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical representations (using mapping or one-hot encoding), and scaling numerical features if necessary. Additionally, feature engineering is performed to create meaningful variables that may improve model performance, such as total spending, average transaction amount, or frequency of purchases. This ensures the dataset is clean, structured, and ready for model training.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization:- EDA focuses on identifying patterns, trends, and relationships between features. Visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and box plots are used to understand demographic distributions, spending habits, and correlations between variables. A correlation matrix and heatmap help identify multicollinearity and important features. This step helps to uncover insights and guide feature selection for the machine learning models.
5. Handling Class Imbalance:- If the dataset has an uneven distribution of high and low spenders, it can bias model predictions. To address this, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied to balance the classes. SMOTE generates synthetic examples of the minority class, ensuring that models learn patterns from both high and low spenders equally, resulting in fairer and more reliable predictions.
6. Feature Selection and Target Definition:-Features (independent variables) and the target variable (spender classification: high or low) are defined. Feature importance analysis may be conducted using methods like correlation analysis or tree-based model feature importance scores. This step ensures that the model uses the most informative variables while reducing noise from irrelevant features.
7. Model Selection and Training:- Multiple supervised learning models are selected to classify customers. This includes Logistic Regression implemented in both TensorFlow and PyTorch, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Each model is trained on the training dataset, allowing them to learn patterns and relationships between customer features and spending behavior. Hyperparameter tuning may be performed to optimize model performance.
8. Model Evaluation and Comparison:- Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and support. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are used to visualize model performance and compare the ability of each model to correctly classify high and low spenders. Radar charts may also be used to provide an overview of multiple evaluation metrics in a single visualization.
9. Visualization of Results:-The predictions and analyses are visualized to communicate insights effectively. This includes plotting ROC curves for each model to assess classification thresholds, confusion matrices to understand misclassification, and radar charts to compare performance across models. Visualization ensures that results are interpretable and actionable for business decision-making.
10. Business Insights and Recommendations:- Finally, the model results are translated into actionable business insights. By analyzing the relationship between spending patterns and demographic or behavioral features, businesses can segment customers, optimize marketing campaigns, tailor offers to high spenders, and improve customer retention strategies. The insights help organizations make data-driven decisions to increase revenue and customer satisfaction.
