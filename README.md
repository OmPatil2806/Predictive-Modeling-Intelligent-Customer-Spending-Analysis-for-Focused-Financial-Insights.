**Predictive Modeling & Intelligent Customer Spending Analysis for Focused Financial Insights**

**📌 Project Overview:-** This project tackles a critical business problem in the retail and financial sectors: understanding and predicting customer spending behavior. In today's competitive landscape, businesses must move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach. This analysis leverages Machine Learning to classify customers into "High Spenders" and "Low Spenders" based on their demographic, financial, and lifestyle attributes.
The primary goal is to empower businesses with data-driven insights for targeted marketing, improved customer segmentation, personalized product recommendations, and more informed credit risk assessments.

**🎯 Business Problem:-** Customers exhibit vast differences in how they allocate their income. While some are big spenders, others manage their finances very carefully. Without a clear understanding of these patterns, businesses struggle to:

1. Tailor financial products effectively.
2. Optimize marketing strategies for the right audience.
3. Enhance customer experiences through personalization.
4. Make informed decisions regarding credit and risk.

This project provides a solution by building predictive models that automatically identify a customer's spending category, enabling focused and intelligent business strategies.

**📊 Data Source:-** The analysis is performed on the "Indian Personal Finance and Spending Habits" dataset, sourced from Kaggle.

1. Dataset Link: [Indian Personal Finance and Spending Habits](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shriyashjagtap/indian-personal-finance-and-spending-habits)
2. Rows: 20,000
3. Columns: 27 (including Income, Age, Occupation, Rent, Groceries, Loan Repayment, Savings, and various spending categories).

**🚀 Objectives**

1. Analyze Trends: Identify the key demographic, lifestyle, and financial factors driving high and low spending behavior.
2. Develop Predictive Models: Build, train, and evaluate multiple ML classification models to accurately categorize customers.
3. Evaluate Model Performance: Ensure robust and reliable predictions using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
4. Identify Key Drivers: Use feature importance analysis to uncover the most significant factors impacting spending patterns.
5. Generate Business Insights: Provide actionable information to aid in customer segmentation, targeted marketing campaigns, and personalized financial advice.

**🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries**

1. Python
2. Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy
3. Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
4. Machine Learning & Preprocessing: scikit-learn (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, LabelEncoder, Train-Test Split, GridSearchCV, etc.)
5. Handling Imbalance: imblearn (SMOTE)
6. Deep Learning: PyTorch

**📈 Methodology**

1. Data Loading & Initial Inspection
2. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
3. Feature Engineering & Model Preparation
4. Model Development & Training
5. Model Evaluation

**📋 Key Results**

1. The project successfully identified key financial ratios and demographic features that are strong indicators of spending behavior.
2. Multiple classification models were trained, with the best-performing model achieving high performance across all evaluation metrics.
3. The feature importance analysis provided clear, actionable insights into what drives customer spending, which can directly inform business strategy.
